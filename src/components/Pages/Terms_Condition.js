          <br />

          <br />
          -> You, or people associated with You may have directly or indirectly
          influenced the outcome of an event; <br />
          -> You, or people associated with You may have access to insider
          knowledge that can influence the outcome of an event; <br />
          -> You, or people associated with You are engaged in arbitrage or
          matched betting; <br />
          -> You and or people associated with You directly or indirectly ignore
          the Rules; <br />

          criminal activity; <br />
          -> A significant change in odds happened, for example due to a public
          announcement in relation to an event; <br />
          -> Bets have been offered, placed and/or accepted that We would not
          have accepted, due to a technical issue affecting the Site at that
          point in time or a mistake, misprint and/or anything which is outside
          Our control. <br />
          8.11 We may close Your Account, cancel and/or refund any of Your
          winnings found in the “Available to Bet” balance, (after the deduction
          of any withdrawal charges), withhold winnings and/or apply debits as
          required (in relation to damage caused by You) without any obligation
          to state a reason or give any notice. If We do this, all valid
          contractual obligations in place at the time of closure will be
          honoured. <br />

          other behaviour detrimental to the Site, We may freeze or close Your

          8.13 We offer fair, open and transparent progressive jackpots on
          specific games for players who use its services for entertainment

          entirely, Your access to the game in question. Should We find it
          necessary, We may also close Your Account with immediate effect. Where
          Your Account has been terminated, We shall not be liable for any
          losses up to the point the Account was closed, nor will We consider
          any refunds on balances remaining on the Account. ‘Abuse’ is defined
          as, but not limited to, software-aided play on multiple games
          concurrently to generate more rounds of a game that could not be done
          naturally by a human player playing alone. Also, the practice of
          ‘cherry-picking’ games with ‘value’ jackpots, to the rank exclusion of
          all other games, will be considered an abuse of the spirit in which
          the jackpot is intended. In all cases where abuse has been proven
          beyond a reasonable doubt, We retain the right to confiscate all of
          the winnings and any balance remaining on the Account. <br />
          8.14 All transactions will be monitored and/or reviewed to prevent
          money laundering.

        <h4>9. Payment Rules</h4>
        <p>
          9.1 Making Deposits Payment methods can be found under both “My
          Account” and “Deposit” pages of the Site. The payment methods made
          available to You may change. Some payment methods may not be available
          in all countries. When choosing a payment method, You agree to the
          terms of that payment method, You agree to any charges that apply, You
          agree that the payment method is valid and You agree that the payment
          account or card belongs to You and that You have the right to use the
          payment method. The billing descriptor for all Bank Card payments will
          show up as it's own website. It is unlawful to deposit money which has
          been obtained illegally. We accept payments made in EUR, BRL, USD or
          such other currency as is made available in the currency drop down
          from time to time. You must choose one currency as the currency of
          Your Account. Any payments received in a currency other than the one
          chosen by you will be converted into the currency of Your Account at
          the exchange rate We choose. Also, any exchange premiums are payable
          by you. When payment is made using a credit card, We may request a
          certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure
          that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are
          visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also
          not visible. We do not accept cash directly or cash delivered to any
          payment solution provider. <br />
          9.2 Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is determined,
          or when We confirm the result of an event, any winnings will be made
          available to you on Your Account. If We mistakenly credit Your Account
          with winnings that do not belong to You for any reason, these will be
          taken back from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings
          before We become aware of this error, You must immediately inform Us
          and will be required to pay this back. If You do not We will take all
          legal action available to us to recover this debt. <br />
          9.3 Withdrawals You may withdraw any amount up to the “Available to
          Bet” balance in Your Account by issuing a valid notice of withdrawal.
          Notices for withdrawals must be made on the Site only. If You want to
          withdraw all Your funds, You must first cancel any outstanding stakes.
          You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the
          Games found on the Site. If You request a withdrawal without turning
          over an amount that is equal or more than the amount deposited, We
          reserve the right to enforce a turnover of the full or part of the
          previous deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal
          requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We suspect that funds
          are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons.
          Prior to accepting a withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal
          identification, for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or
          other such documentation as We feel is required in the circumstances.
          We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other
          such verification as is required to ensure that You are who You say
          You are. If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively exceed EUR 2,000
          (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will carry out
          additional verification procedures. We may also carry out these
          verification procedures even in the case of lower withdrawals. Where a
          withdrawal is to be made using a credit card, We may request a
          certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure
          that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are
          visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also
          not visible. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment
          method chosen by You when placing a deposit, unless We decide
          otherwise or are unable to do so. If You deposit using a number of
          payment methods, We reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across
          such payment methods and process each part through the respective
          payment method at Our discretion and in accordance with anti-money
          laundering policies and regulations. The time for a withdrawal request
          to be finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a withdrawal
          attempt should be approved or denied within three (3) business days.
          When a withdrawal is cancelled, the funds are returned back to your
          account and you can make use of those funds accordingly on the
          account. webiste does not assume any responsibility for any funds lost
          during gameplay following a withdrawal cancellation either by you or
          by us. All winnings of 20,000 EUR or more (excluding progressive
          jackpot wins), we reserve the right to divide the payout into ten
          installments, paid with 10 per cent of the winning sum every month
          until the full amount is paid out. It is at the players discretion to
          request a withdrawal every month until the funds are entirely paid
          out. We may request that You redirect Your withdrawal or cancel it or
          request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in
          accordance with anti-money laundering polices and/or regulations.
          Cancellation of a withdrawal (whether this was made by You or Us) does
          not entitle You to any compensation should You choose to play with the
          funds in Your Account before any withdrawal is completed. We reserve
          the right to charge an administrative fee in the event that You
          proceed with more than 30 approved withdrawals/payout requests during
          one (1) calendar month. The administrative fee shall be 2% of the
          transaction value but no less than EUR 5. It shall be charged on each
          withdrawal following the 30th withdrawal within each given month.{" "}
          <br />
          9.4 Chargebacks If a chargeback on a card or depositing method You
          have used is requested by the payment method provider, We may take the
          following steps: <br />
          -> We may block Your Account; <br />
          -> We may take any such action as we are entitled to by law; <br />
          -> A chargeback notice may be issued and sent to You, using Your
          registration details; <br />
          -> We will use the same payment method as chosen by You when placing a
          deposit in order to issue the chargeback. If We are unable to confirm
          Your identity and the payment method used in order to credit the
          Account in question, We will send out two reminder emails which will
          be subject to an administrative fee of fifty (50) euros each, which
          will be withdrawn from Your Account funds unrelated to the chargeback.
          The balance of Your Account may turn negative in cases of chargeback.

        <h4>11. Dormant & Inactive Accounts</h4>
        <p>
          11.1 An Inactive Account is an Account having a real money balance
          that has not been accessed for an uninterrupted period of 12 months.{" "}
          <br />
          11.2 A Dormant Account is an Account having a real money balance that
          has not been accessed for an uninterrupted period of 30 Months. <br />
          11.3 Once Your Account is inactive, We will contact You via e-mail to
          inform You that We will charge a EUR 5.00 per month administrative
          fee, unless You login to Your Account. <br />
          11.4 If You log-in before Your Account becomes dormant, Your Account
          will no longer be charged the administrative fee. You may also request
          a full refund of the administrative fees charged up until then by
          contacting support. The period of inactivity starts to run again from
          Your last log-in date. <br />
          11.5 If, Your Account becomes dormant, and We are still unable to
          reach You, We, if required, in accordance with the applicable law
          (depending on where You are resident), shall transfer Your remaining
          balance to the relevant regulatory body.
        </p>
        <h4>12. Bonuses</h4>
        <p>
          12.1 Any Bonus is only available once per: person, family, household,
          address, e-mail address, credit card number, bank account, telephone
          number, computer/device and/or IP address. <br />
          12.2 Any “welcome” Bonuses are only available to new customers who
          open an Account on the Site and who have never held an Account on the
          Site before, have never received a welcome offer of any kind and who
          are invited to take part in a welcome offer by virtue of it being
          specifically offered to them when they register on the Site <br />
          12.3 Some Bonuses must be manually activated by You in Your Account.
          Unless stated otherwise, You can do this after logging into Your
          Account and depositing the amount required to access the Bonus. Such
          Bonuses can only be activated when real money is available in Your
          Account. If You play with any of Your deposited funds prior to
          claiming the Bonus, lost funds cannot be used to activate the Bonus.{" "}
          <br />
          12.4 When You claim a Bonus, Your real money, the Bonus and all
          winnings generated from them will remain as Bonus money and may not be
          withdrawn or wagered on other products until wagering requirements are
          met. <br />
          12.5 All Bonuses have a wagering requirement that needs to be
          completed within a given time frame before any potential winnings
          and/or bonuses can be withdrawn. Failure to meet the required wagering
          requirements and/or forfeit of an active Bonus for any reason may
          result in the forfeit of all winnings attained from Your real money as
          well as Your Bonus and bonus winnings attained throughout the wagering
          process of the Bonus. Any attempt to withdraw any funds or cash out
          any placed bets prior to the complete fulfilment of the Bonus wagering
          requirement, may result in the Bonus and any winnings attained
          (including winnings that originated from Your real money used to get
          the Bonus) being forfeited. System bets do not count towards the
          wagering requirements. Only bets that have been placed and settled
          during the campaign period will be considered towards the wagering
          requirements. Any bets that are placed and settled outside this period
          will not count. <br />
          12.6 Any evidence or reasonable suspicion that specific bets were
          placed on any Game (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes
          in the same hand to create "action") without risk will not qualify for
          any wagering requirement. Examples of bets without risk include
          betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting
          player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. If You are found to be
          colluding with other players, for example, one person betting on the
          player, the other betting on the banker, You will have Your bets
          cancelled, Account closed and all deposits made by You may be
          forfeited. <br />
          12.7 If You cancel the Bonus You will lose the Bonus and all winnings
          generated from the Bonus. <br />
          12.8 We have the right to refuse any player a Bonus or We may alter
          the Bonus (including cancellation), if We believe that: <br />
          -> The Bonus is being abused (Our definition of abuse includes but is
          not limited to a player making use of promotional offers without ever
          risking their own funds); <br />
          -> Technical issues have occurred in relation to the Bonus; <br />
          -> The Bonus is, for any reason, not able to be conducted as planned.{" "}
          <br />
          12.9 We offer promotions in good faith to players who use Our services
          for entertainment purposes. We reserve the right to cancel or remove a
          player’s access to these games in the case of suspected abuse of this
          offer and also, should we deem it necessary, to terminate the
          offender’s Account with immediate effect. In the case of an offender’s
          Account being closed, We will not be liable to refund any losses made
          by a player on any Games or to refund any balances on the player’s
          Account. ‘Abuse’ includes but is not limited to using software and/or
          opening multiple accounts in order to gain an unfair advantage on a
          Bonus. In all cases of abuse, We retain the right to withhold all
          winnings and any balances remaining on Your Account. <br />
          12.10 All Bonuses are intended for recreational players and/or as
          tokens of appreciation to Our customers and We therefore reserve the
          right to restrict eligibility to participate in all or part of any
          Bonus. <br />
          12.11 The maximum withdrawal amount allowed from winnings earned from
          any Bonus or free spins offer before a deposit has been made is €100
          or the equivalent in Your Account currency <br />
          12.12 Unless stated otherwise on the specific bonus landing pages, all
          Bonuses in the Casino have got a max bet restriction in place of €5
          per game round or €.50c bet per line (or currency equivalent) and
          failure to adhere to this max bet rule may result in Account closure
          and forfeit of the Bonus and any winnings attained during the wagering
          of the Bonus. For currency equivalent, the following conversion rates
          shall apply unless specifically stated otherwise in the Bonus Terms
          and Conditions: <br />
          -> BRL: R$1 = €4 <br />
          -> USD: €1 = $1 <br />
          12.13 Irregular Play At any time, We may decide to review all records
          and play transactions and/or to monitor Your use of any Bonus or
          Bonuses. If Irregular play is suspected, We reserve the right to
          disqualify You from any free spins promotion or Bonus or other form of
          promotion and/or withhold all deposits and/or winnings and/or close
          Your Account. Irregular play is considered bonus abuse and is not
          permitted on the Site. Irregular play can include (but is not limited
          to): low margin betting, equal betting, zero risk bets or hedge
          betting. These are considered Irregular Play when done purposely to
          exploit Bonuses, in addition the following types of play are
          considered irregular play: <br />
          -> Increasing the balance and then changing Your gaming pattern
          significantly (bet, game type, bet structure or other pattern of
          betting) to complete any wagering requirements of any Bonus; <br />
          -> Using any betting system or placing even money bets on any game of
          chance; and / or <br />
          -> Using the “Double-Up” or gamble feature within a game to increase
          win values; <br />
          -> Increasing Your balance after placing high value bets and
          thereafter proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior bet
          value, in order to meet bonus wagering requirements; <br />
          -> Wagering on Games that do not contribute towards wagering
          requirements or Games with a 0% wagering weight applied to them as
          specified in the specific bonus landing page terms; <br />
          -> Wagering on games with bonus money to build up value, lose the
          bonus and then cash out on the built-up value with a secondary
          deposit; <br />
          -> Short term, repetitive and/or unnecessary deposits and withdrawals
          in order to generate more bonuses. <br />
          12.14 Unless provided otherwise in the bonus scheme, all bonuses for
          stakes, winnings, etc. only apply for starting price and fixed odds
          bets and not for multiples, ante-post bets or Tote betting. Should
          multiples be part of a bonus scheme, the respective bonus shall relate
          to the final winnings amount and not to every leg's winning. <br />
          12.15 Only one Bonus shall be granted per operation (e.g., bet,
          deposit). Should a Customer qualify for several Bonuses, only the
          Bonus with the highest Bonus amount shall be granted.

        <h4>13. Responsible Gaming</h4>
        <p>
          13.1 Gambling can be addictive. If You need some help to overcome such
          addiction, kindly follow this link which will redirect You to Our
          Responsible Gaming page on the Site. Please always gamble responsibly.{" "}
          <br />
          13.2 Limits You may impose limits on Your Account. These limits are:{" "}
          <br />
          13.2.1 Deposit Limit You may choose to limit Your maximum losses. This
          limit will automatically block any further deposits made if the
          deposit limit set has been exceeded for that selected time frame.{" "}
          <br />
          13.2.2 Session Time Limit You may choose to limit the time You spend
          enjoying Our Games. This pop up will appear, reminding You of the time
          limit You imposed on yourself and will allow you to log You out of
          Your Account or continue enjoying Our games. Kindly contact support to
          be able to set this limit. Where a session time limit falls on the
          hour, this pop up will be replaced by the Reality Check if you are
          resident outside of the United Kingdom. If You change Your mind, these
          limits can be changed by letting Us know via e-mail. Increasing or
          revoking a limit shall have effect only after seven (7) days; whereas
          decreasing a limit shall have effect immediately. <br />
          13.3 Reality Check If You are resident outside of the United Kingdom
          and only when playing on casino Games on the Site, a pop up will
          appear which will pause Your Game to remind You that you have been
          playing for one hour. This will be done every hour. This pop up will
          remind You of how much You lost and how much You won. You will then
          select to continue to enjoy Our Games or log out. This pop up might
          appear later than the automatic one hour schedule if Your Game does
          not allow for temporary suspension. This pop up will appear
          immediately after Your Game ends once You have come back to Our lobby.
          We will not always be able to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality
          Check on the time promised. For example, if You play auto spin games,
          live games or games which are not hosted on Our Site We will be unable
          to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check reminders until the
          game has finished or You return to Our lobby. You can deactivate the
          Reality Check at any time by opting-out on the pop up. If You would
          like to reactivate this, kindly contact support or refer to the ‘My
          Account’ tab. <br />
          13.4 Self-Exclusion and Cool Off <br />
          13.4.1 You may choose to completely exclude yourself from playing any
          of the Games on Our Site. To do so You must login and go to the
          Self-Exclusion page. For residents outside of the United Kingdom, You
          stipulate the period You wish to be self-excluded for and Your Account
          will automatically be reactivated. If You are resident in the United
          Kingdom, self-exclusion will apply for a minimum of 6 months and You
          must then contact customer support to have Your Account reactivated.{" "}
          <br />
          13.4.2 You will not be able to open any Account with the Site should
          You opt for selfexclusion. You will also forfeit any entry into any
          competition or draw which was entered into prior to such self
          –exclusion as well as forfeiting any noncash prizes or invitations
          which have been granted to You or offered to You prior to such
          self-exclusion but which have not yet been redeemed or utilised by You
          (for example, where tickets for an event have been offered but the
          event is to take place during a self-exclusion period, the invitation
          is automatically withdrawn upon self-exclusion) . This is to prevent
          gambling being promoted to You in a time where You have taken some
          time to assess Your gambling behaviour. <br />
          13.4.3 You may also choose to “cool off” if you are a UK resident. You
          may want to take a break from gambling and a ‘cooling off period’ can
          be set for a period of: 24 hours, 1 week, 3 weeks or 6 weeks. Please
          contact support or visit this link when logged in to request a cool
          off period. At the end of any cool off period, Your Account will
          automatically be reactivated. <br />
          13.5 Other If We believe that gambling will cause You financial or
          personal difficulties, We may close Your Account. You must not open a
          new Account. If You do so, it will be at Your own risk and We cannot
          be held liable.
